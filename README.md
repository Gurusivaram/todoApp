TodoApp
===============

Todo App is a simple web-based tool that allows you to store temporary lists that you want to remember for a certain period. For instance, when going grocery shopping, it's common to forget the items you need to buy. By noting down these items in the Todo App in your browser, you can easily keep track of them. You can mark items as completed once you've purchased them, or add and remove items as needed while on the go. The app is live on Varcel. Please give it a try. If you like it, please give this repo a Star :)
